## Synopsis
```

MiniPlex: A minimal UDP multiplexer/hub/broker.
ProtoConv: Protocol adapter to convert between a stream and datagrams.

		In combination, a simple way to bolt-on rudimentary multi-cast/multi-path or combine connections for existing applications

## Get MiniPlex

You can download a pre-built binaries for various platforms from the github [Releases](https://github.com/neilstephens/MiniPlex/releases) section. Alternatively, simply build your own copy from source using the instructions below.

## Example Use Case

Suppose you have a network that doesn't support UDP multicast. Maybe it's disabled for security or performance, or maybe you like firewall policies to have strict point-to-point rules.
But you would still like to stream UDP packets to multiple endpoints. This is where MiniPlex can help. MiniPlex can convert a single unicast stream into multiple streams. For example:

### Stream some audio to multiple endpoints:

Run MiniPlex to listen on port 1234 in hub mode any incoming datagrams will be forwarded to all branches.
We specify two fixed branches on the command line, because they will just passively recieve data:

```
./MiniPlex -H -p 1234 -B 192.168.1.5 -b 1234 -B 192.168.1.6 -b 1234
```

Use vlc to stream out some unicast UDP audio:

```
vlc sftp://192.168.1.2/Music/ --sout="#std{access=udp, mux=ts, dst=127.0.0.1:1234}"
```

On the branch hosts (192.168.1.5 and 192.168.1.6 in this example) run vlc to recieve the the audio that is being forwarded by MiniPlex:

```
vlc udp://@:1234
```

## Build

Assuming
  * You've git cloned this repo into a directory called 'MiniPlex' (source directory),
  * Created an adjacent build directory called MiniPlex-bin,
  * Have the appropriate c++20 toolchain installed (earlier version might work, but aren't tested):
    * g++ >= 9.4.0, or
    * clang >= 10.0.0, or
    * MSVC >= VS 2019 v16.11

### Configure the build

```
cmake -S MiniPlex -B MiniPlex-bin
```
This will automatically clone and init the submodules repo dependencies for spdlog, tclap and asio and configure the default build system.

### Run the build
```
cmake --build MiniPlex-bin
```
You should have a MiniPlex executable in MiniPlex-bin. See the synopis above for how to use it.
